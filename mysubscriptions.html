    <h1>MySubscriptions Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 3, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MySubscriptions is a subscription tracking app. Your subscription data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced across your devices via Apple's iCloud service.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>MySubscriptions does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or share any personal data with the developer or any third party. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data is sent to external servers.</li>
        <li>No analytics or tracking data is collected.</li>
        <li>No account or login is required.</li>
        <li>No cookies or identifiers are used.</li>
        <li>No advertising or third-party SDKs are included.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled on your device, MySubscriptions may sync your subscription data across your Apple devices using Apple's CloudKit service. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. The developer has no access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>MySubscriptions can send local notifications to remind you of upcoming subscription renewals. These notifications are generated entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores subscription information you enter (names, prices, billing cycles, categories, and notes) locally on your device using SwiftData. This data remains on your device (and in your iCloud account if sync is enabled) and is never accessible to the developer.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>MySubscriptions does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only external service used is Apple's iCloud for optional data sync.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MySubscriptions does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy is updated, the changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
